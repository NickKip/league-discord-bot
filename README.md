# League of Legends Discord Bot

A small League of Legends Discord bot which you can add to your Discord server. Once added, you can then send a message to the bot in the format of:

`!register your-summoner-name`

The bot will then watch for when you start playing League and automatically query LolSkill for your current game. It will then send the results to you in a message via Discord.

Built in `Typescript` using `VS Code`. Feel free to go ham with it. Modify the `src/Config/Config.ts` file to start.

Enjoy!
